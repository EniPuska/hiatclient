# hiatclient
The main purpose of this project is to be used by New York College students as a place to practice, play with code, 
and maybe work during their final project. Hopefully it will manage to turn into a usefull application over time.
This project is a simple client app. Students can specify the degree of interest and understanding of the topic discussedin 
class and the aggregated values are transferred to their tutor (hiatserver). 

For the server side look for the hiatserver project.
